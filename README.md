# bug2progress

bug2progress is a RESTful API aimed at building a backend for bugtracker application.

The repository for [frontend](https://github.com/snh1999/bug2progress-frontend).

### 🚀 Getting Started

1. Node.js (v20+), Docker and Docker Compose (for database/PostgreSQL) and [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/installation), [`prisma`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/quickstart) is required to run this project. Make sure there is [`node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en) and [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) is installed beforehand.

```bash
# to install pnpm
npm install -g pnpm
```

2. Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/snh1999/bug2progress
cd bug2progress
pnpm install
```

3. Docker compose to manage database. [Note- make sure you check the `docker-compose.yml`]

```bash
docker compose up db -d
```

4. Setup the environment variables, there is a sample `.env.sample` file provided.

5. Database Setup(make sure the database is running)

```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate
# Run migrations
npx prisma migrate dev
```

5. finally run the server

```bash
pnpm run start:dev
```

6. The API will be available at http://localhost:8080/api/v1 (you can change the port in the `main.ts` file)
   To view swagger documentation, visit `http://localhost:8080/api` (given you have not changed the port in `main.ts`)

7. Other available scripts

```bash
# Development
pnpm run start:debug      # Start in debug mode
pnpm run start:prod       # Start production build

# Building
pnpm run build            # Build the application
pnpm run start            # Start built application

# Database
pnpm run db:dev-deploy   # Deploy migrations to dev database
pnpm run db:test-deploy  # Deploy migrations to test database
pnpm run db:seed         # Seed database
npx prisma generate      # Generate Prisma client
npx prisma migrate dev   # Apply migrations


# Testing
npm run test:e2e         # Run end-to-end tests

# Code Quality
npm run lint             # Run ESLint
npm run format           # Format code with Prettier
```

## API Documentation

It is better to use seeder to generate data (`pnpm run db:seed`) and run requests from [`http file`](requests.http) one by one should give proper idea on response types.
(I will be working on producing proper API documentation as soon as possible)
